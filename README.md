HR Database Analysis

Hi everyone, who is reading this ðŸ‘‹

This is my Data Analystâ€™s portfolio project, that is aimed to demonstrate my SQL and Visualisation skills.

Environment used in this project:
MySQL Workbench & MySQL Server;
IBM Cognos Analytics.

Introduction

Data:

The database used in this set is taken from the Â«Real World Fake DataÂ» dataset. They provide convenient datasets that are perfect for practice being both easy to understand and challenging to clean.

For now I chose the HR database that contains information about current and former employees of a fictional company.

Project goals:

Create the table and input data into it;
Clean the data;
Do data manipulation to answer the project questions;
Visualise the key findings in a specialised environment.
